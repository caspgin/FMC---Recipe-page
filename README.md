## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Neovim

### What I learned
- I have tried to keep the tailwindcss code in parent tags so it is clean and more redable. Please let me know if I succeeded.
- I was able to figure out how to use psuedo classes and states like hover with tailwindcss. That was fun part.
- I am not completely sure I used the main tag properly.
    - I used it first just for Instruction and Ingredient section. But I am not sure that was correct either.
    - Please advice on how you use the main tag.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://www.tailwindcss.com/docs) - The docs of tailwind are amazing.
